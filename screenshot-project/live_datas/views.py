def data(request):
    """
    Django view to retrieve and display the most recent cloud analysis data
    from the 'Cloud' model.

    This view is specifically designed to show data only from the single,
    absolute latest "update loop" or "batch" that exists in the database.

    It works as follows:
    1. Identifies if the request is an AJAX call (for JSON response) or a
       standard browser request (for HTML rendering).
    2. Queries the database to find the highest (latest) timestamp across
       *all* records in the Cloud model. This timestamp represents the
       time of the most recent data update.
    3. If a latest timestamp is found, it then filters the Cloud records
       to include only those entries that exactly match this absolute
       latest timestamp. This ensures that only data belonging to the
       most recent "loop" of updates is retrieved.
    4. Orders the retrieved data by city name for consistent display.
    5. Based on the request type (AJAX or standard), it either:
       - Returns the filtered data as a JSON object (for dynamic updates).
       - Renders an HTML template ('live_datas/live.html') with the data
         passed in the context (for initial page load).

    # or if the client specifically requested JSON format via a GET parameter.
    is_ajax = request.headers.get('x-requested-with') == 'XMLHttpRequest' or request.GET.get('format') == 'json'

    # Step 1: Find the single, absolute latest timestamp across ALL records in the Cloud table.
    # This is done by aggregating the maximum 'timestamp' value from the entire model.
    # The result will be a dictionary, e.g., {'timestamp__max': datetime.datetime(...)}.
    absolute_latest_timestamp_obj = Cloud.objects.aggregate(Max('timestamp')) # Using Cloud model
    absolute_latest_timestamp = absolute_latest_timestamp_obj['timestamp__max']

    # Initialize an empty list to hold the cloud data. This list will be populated
    # only if an absolute latest timestamp is found, ensuring graceful handling
    # when the database table is empty.
    latest_cloud_data = []

    # Step 2: If an absolute latest timestamp was found (meaning the database is not empty),
    # proceed to filter the records.
    if absolute_latest_timestamp:
        # Filter the Cloud records to include only those whose 'timestamp'
        # exactly matches the 'absolute_latest_timestamp' found in the previous step.
        # This effectively selects all records that were part of the most recent data update.
        # The results are then ordered by 'city' for consistent presentation.

            # to a specific local timezone is needed for the client,
            # timezone.localtime(record.timestamp) could be used before strftime.
